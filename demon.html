              her back into a human, and it is to this end that he decides
             to join the Demon Slayer Corps. He initially trained under Sakonji Urokodaki</td>

             Despite Muzan's assumption that he killed them all in his attempt to sire 
             a sun-resistant demon, Nezuko survived as a demon with her mind mostly gone.
              However, she retained enough of her memories to keep herself from killing Tanjiro. Due
               to two years of hypnotic conditioning by Urokodaki, Nezuko regards 
            all humans as her family and will mercilessly attack any demon that threatens them.</td>

             him, partially out of his infatuation with Nezuko, but also due to recognizing how honest and kind he is.</td>

<h2>Demons</h2>
<img class="oo" src="demon.jpg" alt="">
<p>The Demons (鬼おに, Oni) are immortal creatures who feed on human flesh and blood to 
    \survive and become stronger with each human they devour. All demons are former humans 
    who lose most of their memories and almost all traces of humanity after drinking or being 
    injected with Muzan Kibutsuji's blood becoming his servants and sharing their own vision and 
    thoughts with him. Higher Demons are also capable of casting powerful magic spells called Blood 
    Demon Arts (血鬼術, Kekkijutsu). The specifics of these spells are unique to each Demon.
    All Demons are weak to sunlight, being easily destroyed upon being exposed to it, 
    but they can be also killed by decapitation with special swords used by the Demon Slayers 
    called Nichirin Blades (日にち輪りん刀とう, Nichirin Tō). Demons also are highly intolerant to
     wisteria flowers, avoiding places where such plants are abundant and wisteria extract can be 
     lethal to them in high doses.</p>

<h3>Tanjito's teacher</h3>

<p>Urokodaki. A former Water Hashira; He is introduced to Tanjiro and Nezuko by his student Giyu. He is initially apprehensive of Tanjiro's
     kind nature, but agrees to train him. As the training goes on, he grows closer to both Tanjiro and Nezuko, and he sheds tears 
     of joy, when Tanjiro returns from the Demon Slayer exam alive, as he is the first to do so after a long string of deaths. He 
     has since kept a close eye on their growth. He has given his word to the Pillars that if Nezuko were to eat a human, then 
     Tanjiro, as well Giyu and himself would kill her and themselves in atonement.</p>

     <p>A demon and former member of the Twelve Kizuki, Kyogai is known as the "Tsuzumi Demon" (鼓の鬼, Tsuzumi no Oni). He was
          stripped of his number by Muzan due to slowly losing the ability to eat humans and reaching his "limit". Because of this,
           he obsessively tries to earn his spot back in the Twelve Kizuki, attacking and eating humans who pass by the Tsuzumi
            Mansion. Prior to becoming a demon, Kyogai was an unsuccessful poet whose works were rejected by his father. He fights 
            using the tsuzumi drums embedded into his body; striking them would turn rooms around and while changing rooms
             throughout the house and creating powerful air slashes. Kyogai is slain in a grueling battle by Tanjiro.</p>

<img class="oo" src="saa.jpg" alt="">
<p>Yahaba (矢琶羽, Yahaba)
    A demon who directly serves Muzan. While he believes that he is one of the Twelve Kizuki, he is actually not, as he lacks a 
    number on his eye: the mark of a Kizuki. His power is to manipulate the movement and direction of things using the eyeballs on
     the palms of his hands. He works together with Susamaru and is killed by Tanjiro.</p>
<p>Susamaru (朱紗丸, Susamaru)

     sleep. Enmu, Lower Rank One of the Twelve Kizuki, instructs four passengers, all suffering from severe insomnia, to enter
      the Demon Slayers' dreams and destroy their spiritual cores so that they can't wake up again. In exchange, Enmu will allow
       them a peaceful sleep.During their sleep, Tanjiro and his companions have happy dreams. Tanjiro realizes that he is
        dreaming and tries to wake up, succeeding after a vision of his father instructs him to kill himself in the dream.

         Enmu, they attack Tanjiro, who knocks them out.While Nezuko awakens the others, Tanjiro confronts Enmu, and in the 
         ensuing battle, beheads him. However, Enmu does not die, and reveals that he fused his head with the train. Kyōjurō
          instructs Inosuke and Tanjiro to look for Enmu's neck while he, Nezuko, and Zenitsu stay behind to protect the other
